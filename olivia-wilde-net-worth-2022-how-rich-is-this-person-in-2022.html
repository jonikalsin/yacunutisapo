I think people see pregnancy as something to get over with, but every stage of becoming a mother is really special.”&nbsp;</p><p>“The difference between romantic love and friendship love is that romantic love involves a lot of compromises. It is a very giving type of love. With friendship, you can be a little bit more autonomous. You are not expected to compromise, in the same way. Maybe that’s why friendships tend to last longer.”<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“The mark of a good marriage is the partnership and continuing to feel inspired by your spouse. I had that with Tao. But the end is not necessarily the tragedy. Staying in a relationship that is no longer working is a tragedy. Living unhappily – that’s the tragedy.”</p><p>“I have a lot of friends who I really feel like I can kick back with and let all pretense go and be very comfortable with.”&nbsp;</p><p>“As a woman who works in a male-dominated business – Hollywood, definitely, is one of them – I instinctually knew what that is like. You have to be strong and take care of yourself.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6S5qsLImmSwoZyZsm66xK1ksKeiqbVufo9raWagn6x6s7XCoWSiq12ptaq%2FjKmcq6ufo3qquoxrZ2tqX2eAd4OTaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./rebecca-becky-johnson-obituary.html>&#171;&nbsp;Rebecca Becky Johnson Obituary: Marquette community Mourning the passing of Jean Johnson, pass</a>
