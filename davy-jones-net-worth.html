He passed away in 2012.</p><p>So just how rich was Davy Jones? Sources state that Jones had acquired a net worth of over $5 million, as of mid-2016. His wealth had been earned through his involvement in the music and television industries.</p><h3>Davy Jones Net Worth $5 Million</h3><p>Jones was raised by a homemaker and a railroad fitter. He became popular in his early teenage years, then being cast as Colin Lomax in an episode of the British soap opera “Coronation Street” in 1961. The following year he appeared in the BBC police series “Z-Cars”, and went on to pursue a career as a horse racing jockey, dropping out of elementary school at the age of 14 and taking a job as an apprentice jockey for Basil Foster. This led him to be cast as the Artful Dodger in a London production of the musical “Oliver!”, the role which brought him to America’s Broadway in 1963 and earned him a Tony nomination. In 1964 Jones appeared in “The Ed Sullivan Show”, in the same episode that The Beatles debuted. Not long after, he signed a contract with Ward Sylvester of Screen Gems, who brought him to Los Angeles and arranged guest appearances for him in the television series “Ben Casey” and “The Farmer’s Daughter”.</p><p>In the meantime, Jones released his debut single “What Are We Going To Do?” in 1965, and shortly after that his debut album “David Jones” came out. His net worth started to rise, even more so when in 1966 Jones was selected to perform in “The Monkees”, NBC’s television series portraying a pop-rock band modeled after the Beatles. The band, titled as the series itself, consisted of Jones, <a href=#>Michael Nesmith</a>, <a href=#>Peter Tork</a> and <a href=#>Micky Dolenz</a>. Both the band and the series enjoyed an astonishing popularity among worldwide audiences, including through nine successful albums released during the band’s five-year-old career, with hit singles such as <a href=#>Neil Diamond’s</a> tunes “I’m a Believer”, “Last Train to Clarksville” and “Little Bit Me, Little Bit You”, <a href=#>Gerry Goffin</a> and <a href=#>Carole King’s</a> “Pleasant Valley Sunday”, and John Stewart’s “Daydream Believer”. As for the series, it won two Emmy Awards. In 1968 The Monkees band starred in their own feature film “Head”. The same year the series was canceled, but receiving a long afterlife in reruns, syndication and overseas broadcasts. The band, although shortened by one member, went on to release their last album in 1969, before splitting up in 1971. However, subsequent reunion albums and tours followed in the next decades. All contributed to Jones’ wealth.</p><p>After The Monkees split up, Jones went on with his singing and acting careers, releasing a self-titled album and appearing in the popular television series “The Brady Bunch”, in an episode which became the most re-run episode of any television show ever, and in which Jones sang his most recognized solo recording, “Girl”. From then on, he has guest starred in numerous other series, appearing in “The Brady Brunch” movie, acted in several plays, released a few albums and singles and performed numerous solo concerts. In a collaboration with musical director Douglas Trevor, Jones worked on the ABC television special “Pop Goes Davy Jones”.</p><p>Aside from singing and acting, Jones was the owner of two boutiques which he opened in the 60s. He has also written the autobiographies: “They Made A Monkee Out Of Me”, “They Made A Monkee Out Of Me…Again”, “Mutant Monkees Meet the Masters of the Multi-Media Manipulation Machine!” and “Daydream Believin'”, intensifying his net worth.</p><p>The artist died of heart attack in 2012.</p><p>In his private life, Jones was married three times. In 1968 he married Dixie Linda Haines, with whom he had two children. After their divorce in 1975, Jones married Anita Pollinger in 1981, and also had two children with her. They divorced in 1996. His third wife was Jessica Pacheco(m. 2009), who remained with Jones until his death.</p><p>An avid equestrian, Jones owned several thoroughbred race horses. In 1996, he won his first race in England. He also participated in numerous sporting events for charity.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=31.964401294498><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>December 30, 1945, in Manchester, Lancashire, England</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Died</td><td>February 29, 2012, Stuart, Florida, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.6&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Profession</td><td>Singer, songwriter, musician, actor, businessman</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>British</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Spouse</td><td>Jessica Pacheco Jones (2009–2012, his death), Anita Pollinger (1981–1996), Linda Haines (1968–1975)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Children</td><td>Jessica Lillian Jones, Sarah Lee Jones, Talia Elizabeth Jones, Annabel Charlotte Jones</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Parents</td><td>Doris Jones, Harry Jones, Daydream Believer, I'm A Believer, Last Train to Clarksville</td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm0427888</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.29090909090909><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.allmusic.com/artist/davy-jones-mn0000232677</a></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Awards</td><td>Grammy Hall of Fame (2008), TV Land Favorite Guest Performance by a Musician on a TV Show Award (2003)</td></tr><tr><td>Record Labels</td><td>Colpix, Bell Records</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Albums</td><td>"David Jones" (1965, 1967), "The Point" (1978), "Davy Jones Live" (1981), "Hello Davy (Davy Jones Live)" (1982)</td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>"The Monkees" (1966)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nominations</td><td>Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Movies</td><td>"Head (1968)", "Oliver Twist" (1974), " The Brady Bunch Movie" (1995), "Sexina (2007)"</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>TV Shows</td><td>"Oliver!", "Love, American Style", "My Two Dads", "Coronation Street", "Z-Cars", "The Ed Sullivan Show" (1964), "The Brady Bunch" (1969-1974), "The Farmer's Daughter" (1963-1966)</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks readability=1><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Short Stature</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>Strong Manchester English Accent</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=13.502032520325><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>I have four daughters.
