She has worked with several notable personalities in the music and movie industry. But who is she?</p><p>Find out more as you scroll down this article.</p><h3><strong>Lynn Ban On Bling Empire</strong></h3><p>Lynn Ban who by trade is a jeweler is literally bringing a “bling” to the Bling Empire: New York, which premiered on 20 January 2022. The show like its original follows the lavish life of wealthy Asian Americans. She was already famous when she decided to join the Netflix show. But why she decided to join the show? She told WWD, “I wanted to share my story of how I immigrated here, worked my way up, and navigated being an Asian mother, wife, and designer in the fashion industry, balancing work and my home life.”</p><p>Lynn wanted the fans of the original show to know that the “crazy rich Asian” world is “not only a life of private jets, shopping sprees and parties”.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Lynn Ban Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Years of working in the jewelry and fashion industry have amassed Lynn Ban with a whopping net worth of $5 million. The antique fashion archivist and 25-year fashion industry veteran Lynn Ban launched her eponymous custom jewelry company Lynn Ban Jewelry in 2011.</p><p>Some of the biggest celebrities in the entertainment world, including Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Madonna, and Post Malone, have worn her creations, which have been purchased by upscale retailers like Barneys and Net-a-Porter. Rihanna is by far the most famous of the celebrities with whom she has worked with. The singer frequently dons designer clothes for press conferences, music videos, photo shoots, and photo tours.</p><p>“Lynn has always supported me at the beginning of my career and has always done amazing things,” Rihanna’s stylist and creative director Jahleel Weaver <a href=#>told</a> Vogue. “I’m excited for what she is going to do in the future.”</p><p>“My design philosophy is to create a statement piece, something that hasn’t been seen before or a twist on something traditional. Its design should still be timeless, bold yet functional,” Lynn shared while speaking to The Straits Times.</p><p>Lynn cut back on her company during the pandemic and appeared to be concentrating solely on private client custom commissions. She did, however, introduce her first resort collection in March 2022. Many people, including Tina Leung and Ezra William, came to the celebration of the project. It appears that Lynn and Como Resorts planned the collection before the pandemic, working together.</p><p>“I don’t want to be fixed to any schedule. It is a labor of love,” she told. “It is a resort collection for when you go on vacation, and you want to buy something fabulous that isn’t plain Jane.”</p><p>“I have been fortunate enough to be able to start my own businesses, but let’s be real — there are no shortcuts for anyone in building a career,” Lynn told&nbsp;Women’s Wear Daily.</p><p>In 2002, she launched Lynn Ban Vintage at Barneys New York with a curated selection of vintage couture (Chanel, Valentino, and Yves Saint Laurent from between the 1960s and 1990s). She followed this with the first pop-up of Lynn Ban Vintage at Harvey Nichols in <a href=# rel=noopener>London</a>&nbsp;and Celux in Tokyo. The latter is a private members-only club in the penthouse of the Louis Vuitton flagship in Omotesando.</p><p>Lynn also assists in running the American Genki Sushi franchise. Her father started the business in Singapore and Hong Kong, China, and she made the decision to assist in bringing it to the west. But closed it afterward. After graduating from college in 1996, she launched this business with the assistance of her husband.</p><p>Lynn went off to New York University, then did French literature and art history at Cornell University, and has stayed in New York ever since. She also spent two years at the Paris-Sorbonne University pursuing art history.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Lynn Ban?</strong></h3><p>Born on 27 May 1973, Lynn Ban is currently 49 years old as of Jan 2023.</p><h3><strong>Lynn Ban Family</strong></h3><p>Lynn Ban is the daughter of Patricia and David Ban. Her mother worked as a gemologist while her dad was a real estate tycoon. David is currently working as the executive director of the Kuala Lumpur-based developer Venus Assets.</p><p>On 1 February 2020, Lynn wished her mom a birthday via an IG post. She wrote there, “Happy Birthday to my fabulous mom! Always there for me, always my biggest fan, always up for anything, always in my heart! LOVE YOU <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz notranslate _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>@hotpatban.”</a></p><p>Lynn inherited her sense of style from her mother. Patricia studied fashion design and is a Gemological Institute of America-certified gemologist. She loves rummaging through the older woman’s closet and appropriates pieces she finds interesting. Mother and daughter also visit department stores and goodwill thrift shops in search of vintage pieces together.</p><h3><strong>Lynn Ban Gender</strong></h3><p>Lynn Ban is a female, and she/her is her pronoun.</p><h3><strong>Is Lynn Ban Married?</strong></h3><p>Yes, Lynn Ban is married and has been married for 27 years to be precise. She and her husband <a href=#>Jett Kain</a> reportedly met at a New Year’s Eve party back in 1994. The spark flew instantly for her husband right when he saw her. He still recalls her dancing in high heels and a very short skirt on a speaker when he first approached her to ask for her number, blissfully unknowing that she would give him the incorrect one.</p><p>As luck would have it, they crossed paths again at a dinner party held by friends of theirs a few months later, and this time the fashionista was fairly receptive to his overt attempts. Thus, Lynn and Jett started dating, which clearly made them so tremendously happy despite their fundamental cultural differences that they decided to get married a few years later.</p><p>But their relationship doesn’t only limit them to being life partners. Her husband has essentially managed everything behind the scenes to assure exposure, particularly press and marketing, while Lynn has always concentrated on the creative component of this brand.</p><p>Despite the fact that they have experienced their fair share of problems—especially given how direct they both are—they have remained completely committed to one another throughout it all. Jett and Lynn consistently listen to one another with the intention of coming to an amicable solution. The Netflix original series’ last episode, in which the character eventually admitted he’s not just considering starting something on his own but has also already secured a job in LA, serves as a good illustration of this.</p><p>His wife did become unhappy, but only because he had thought she would stay in New York; otherwise, she had been wholly supportive. She was so pleased that their lengthy commute would travel directly from New York-London to New York-California that she even smiled.</p><h3><strong>Lynn Ban Son</strong></h3><p>The married couple shares a son together named <a href=#>Sebastian</a> Kain. Sebastian turned 14 years old on 16 March 2022. He is currently attending boarding school in England, according to <a href=#>10Magazine</a>.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>What Is Lynn Ban Nationality?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Lynn Ban was born in Singapore but is of American nationality.
