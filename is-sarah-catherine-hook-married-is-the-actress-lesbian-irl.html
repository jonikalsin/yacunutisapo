If that is the case, there is a new Netflix show around the corner we think you will like‚ÄìFirst Kill. First Kill is Netflix‚Äôs first attempt at doing a lesbian vampire show and thus is one of the most anticipated shows this summer. It stars Sarah Catherine Hook (as a vampire) and Imani Lewis (as a vampire hunter) in the lead and both of them are ready to make their first kill. Things get tricky as both of them begin to fall for each other.</p><p>In this article, we will talk about Sarah Catherine Hook‚Äôs role in Netflix‚Äôs First Kill, her married life, net worth, family, and more.</p><h3><strong>Sarah Catherine Hook On Netflix‚Äôs First Kill</strong></h3><p>Actress Sarah Catherine Hook plays the role of Juliette Fairmont, a teenage vampire, on First Kill, which will premiere on Netflix on June 10th 2022.</p><p>Juliette is ‚Äúa shy, kind teenage girl who was born a vampire and determined to not be a monster.‚Äù Sarah‚Äôs character description further reads: ‚ÄúHer family has always supported her, but as she comes into her own, her quest for love is challenged by her legacy.‚Äù</p><p>Based on a short story by V.E. Schwab, First Kill follows teenage vampire, Juliette Fairmont, who sets her sights on Calliope Burns, a new girl in town, when she is required to make her ‚Äòfirst kill‚Äô in order to take her rightful place among a powerful vampire. Little did Juliette realize that Calliope is actually a vampire hunter and hails from a family of powerful, celebrated slayers. For Calliope‚Äôs part, she is also required to make her first kill. Things get tricky when these two people who are supposed to kill each other fall in love with each other.</p><p>Sarah Catherine Hook joined the cast of Netflix‚Äôs YA vampire series in early 2021.

She shared that when she got the audition, she did not think she would even be considered for the role of Juliette since the physical description of the character was very different from who she was. Fortunately, she got the part and with every additional audition her love for Juliette increased, she told.</p><p>Recently, on May 12th, Sarah also shared the trailer of First Kill on her IG.
