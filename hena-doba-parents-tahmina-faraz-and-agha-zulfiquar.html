Her parents had moved to New York a few months before she was born. She said they did it not only for a better life but to ensure that their children had opportunities that they never imagined. “Till this day, they believe anything is possible in this country with hard work, grit, and discipline”, Hena said talking about her folks and the States.</p><p>Hena was leaving with her parents until the September 11 attacks happened on 11 September. She said she picked up her camcorder and left her parents’ house trying to make her way into Manhattan; while interviewing New Yorkers along the way. That is when her career in front of the camera started. After a few short years, she was the first Pakistani TV anchor in the United States.</p><h3><strong>Meet Hena Doba Mother, Tahmina Faraz</strong></h3><p>According to our research, Tahmina Faraz is Hena Doba’s mother.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Tahmina Faraz Age</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Tahmina Faraz was born sometime in 1957. So, she turned 65 years old in 2022.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Tahmina Faraz Job</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Professionally, Tahmina is the CEO of KAM Sales & Services corp., a business entity registered with the State of New York, Department of State (NYSDOS). The business is based in Pine Brook Ave, West Hempstead, and its type is a domestic business corporation. On her LinkedIn, she also mentioned working as an ocean export manager at R&A In international Logistics&nbsp;from September 2007 through the present.</p><p>Then, on her Facebook BIO, Tahmina also cited working in the export and import at PRIME Transport as of 14 October 2020.</p><p>Also, so you know, a contract-debt collection lawsuit was filed against her by DISCOVER BANK in December 2020. This case was filed in Nassau County Courts, Supreme Court in Washington, New York, and its status was reportedly pending.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>What Is Tahmina Faraz Nationality?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Tahmina was based in West Hempstead, a hamlet and census-designated place in the Town of Hempstead in Nassau County, on Long Island, in New York. As of now and she must have acquired American citizenship.</p><h3><strong>Meet Hena Doba Father, Agha Zulfiqar</strong></h3><p>Hena Doba’s father is Agha Zulfiqar.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Agha Zulfiqar Age</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Agha Zulfiqar was born in September 1945. So, he should have turned 76 years old in 2021.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Agha Zulfiqar Job</strong></h4></li></ul><p>On his LinkedIn, Agha Zulfiqar introduces himself as the director of Wizz Professional Interpretation Company; in tenure for the past 25 years and more. Other than that, he says he is a US Federal Courts and New Jersey State Courts Certified Interpreter in Urdu, Punjabi, and Hindi languages.</p><p>Then, we also collected, that his namesake company Agha Zulfiqar Show Inc. has been operating for the past two decades; is registered as a domestic business corporation.</p><p>Agha did his master’s twice; once in Political Science and Government at the New York University and before that at Karachi University.

Zulfiqar of Jackson Heights, Queens.” This looked like Hena’s parents were no longer together. But for sure there has been no clue, as to if they are really divorced, or just living separately, or just were apart at the time for work purposes.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>How Many Kids Do Hena Doba Parents Have?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Other than her, Hena Doba’s parents have two sons Humara N Zulfiqar and Waqas A Zulfiqar.
