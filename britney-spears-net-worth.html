This is according to outlets such as </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span style=font-weight:400>Celebrity Net Worth</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>. No wonder Spears was looking to upgrade from her <a href=# rel=noopener>$10 million former mansion in Calabasas</a>, Calif., just nine months after <a href=# rel=noopener>marrying dancer Sam Asghari</a>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Britney Spears was born in McComb, Miss. At a young age, Spears was already exposed to the entertainment industry. As an 8-year-old, she auditioned for The All-New Mickey Mouse Club. Although she didn’t get accepted because of her age, Spears still kickstarted her career in the entertainment industry.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Spears acted in TV commercials. Moreover, she also studied at&nbsp;</span><span style=font-weight:400><a href=# rel=noopener>New York’s Professional Performing Arts School</a> for three summers</span><span style=font-weight:400>. While studying, Spears was hired for the Off-Broadway play, Ruthless.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Britney Spears joins The Mickey Mouse Club</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>At age 11, Spears showcased her potential on the TV show, Star Search. She covered Eva Tanguay’s I Don’t Care and The Judds’ Love Can Build a Bridge.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Shortly after, at a turn of events, Spears was cast in the teenage edition of The Mickey Mouse Club. Here, Spears appeared alongside future stars such as Justin Timberlake, Christina Aguillera, Ryan Gosling, Keri Russell, and JC Chasez.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Britney Spears joins girl group Innosense</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Afterwards, Spears went on to study at Parklane Academy. However, she would eventually drop out of high school. Later on, given her love for music, Spears would join the girl group, Innosense.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The band was penciled to be a rival to Spice Girls. Although there were plans for Spears to be the lead, the band never took off, which prompted Spears to go solo.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Britney Spears goes solo, signs with Jive Records</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Despite Innosense not taking off, Spears’ solo career started off with a bang. She impressed the executives from Jive Records and </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span style=font-weight:400>signed with them in 1997</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>She was paid a signing bonus of $250,000 to go along with a royalty rate of less than a dollar per record sold.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Britney Spears releases …Baby One More Time</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>By 1999, Spears released her studio album debut, …Baby One More Time. The album was an instant hit. It reached the pole position of the U.S. Billboard 200. But more importantly, the album earned platinum distinction. According to </span><span style=font-weight:400>RCA</span><span style=font-weight:400>, as of this writing, the album has already sold <a href=# rel=noopener>at least 27 million copies</a> worldwide, which is ranked as the 17th best-selling album in history.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>On top of that, the main single of the album, …Baby One More Time, became the fastest-selling single in history by a female artist. The song sold 500,000 units on the first day of its release.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Britney Spears releases Oops!… I Did It Again</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>After releasing …Baby One More Time, Spears followed that up with another hit studio album, Oops!… I Did It Again, in 2000. The album made record-breaking debut sales within the first week, selling a whopping </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>1.3 million copies</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>. This was considered to be the most at that time by any solo artist, and the record stood for </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>15 years</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The album would also contain four iconic singles such as Oops!… I Did It Again, Stronger, Lucky, and Don’t Let Me Be the Last to Know. As of this writing, the album has already sold at least 20 million copies around the world.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Britney Spears' other hits</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Spears would go on to produce more hits such as I’m a Slave 4 U, Me Against the Music, Piece of Me, Circus, Toxic, and many more. While Spears has earned from her hit studio albums, she also earns a lot from world tours and her Las Vegas residency. Spears’ world tours have raked in approximately $500 million.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>On top of that, in 2013, Spears inked a </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>$30 million deal</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> to perform shows in Las Vegas. This meant Spears would get paid $310,000 per show. A year later, Las Vegas extended her deal and paid her even more money. The deal would pay Spears </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>$475,000 per performance,</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> which potentially makes a lucrative $66.5 million in total.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Britney Spears' acting roles</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Although Spears has earned a lot as an artist, she has also done some acting on the big screen and for TV shows. She starred in the 2002 film, Crossroads. In 2012, she served as a judge for the TV show, The X-Factor. For her job here, Spears earned a paycheck of </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>$15 million</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>While Spears has succeeded as a musician, off the stage, she’s also a highly successful endorser and entrepreneur. Spears released her first perfume with Elizabeth Arden in 2004 with a name called Curious. The perfume was an instant hit, as it raked in </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>$100 million in revenue</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>. According to Spears’ brother, as of 2020, Spears’ perfume line has already accumulated over </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>$100 billion in sales</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Aside from perfumes, Spears has also tried her hand as a fashion designer. She launched a collection, in partnership with </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Candies</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h2>Britney Spears' battle over conservatorship with Jamie Spears</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Good God I love my fans so much it’s crazy 🥺❤️ !!!
