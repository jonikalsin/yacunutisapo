Questions about whether he has a girlfriend or someone to call his wife often emerge.&nbsp;All we can say is that he is a family man who loves his children. He adores his daughter and often discusses her adventures on social media.&nbsp;Brady is also still friendly with his ex-wife in order to co-parent. Here’s all you need to know about Brady’s personal life and children.</p><h2>Wayne Brady’s Wedding</h2><p>Brady has had two marriages. His first marriage lasted around two years and was with Diana Lasso. Mandie Taketa, a former dancer, was his second wife. The public had no clue when The Masked Singer star and Taketa exchanged vows that their marriage would end in divorce. Brady met Taketa while working in Hawaii, and the couple married on April 5, 1999. They had been married for precisely eight years when they divorced on April 5, 2006. They cited irreconcilable differences as the grounds for divorce. Unlike most divorces, Brady and Taketa remain close friends. According to the Let’s Make a Deal presenter, the breakup was amicable and they will remain “best of friends and dedicated parents.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Wayne-Brady-1.jpg><h2>Wayne Brady’s daughter Maile Brady</h2><p>Wayne Brady has a daughter called Maile with Taketa. Following their divorce, Taketa sought shared legal and physical custody of Maile, which was awarded to the pair. Celebrities claiming to be buddies after a breakup is not unusual. However, the pair decided to live close to each other in an effort to co-parent Maile effectively.</p><p>Brady posted a video on Instagram in August 2021 about co-parenting with Taketa. He explained their daughter was starting college, and they dropped her off at her dorm.&nbsp;He stated that co-parenting was challenging, and that it felt like “hell” at times. He also confessed that he and Taketa fought a lot and did not want to talk to each other for days.&nbsp;Regardless of the ups and downs, the two were proud to raise their kid. They appreciated and thanked each other for having one another’s back and co-parenting in the best way they could.&nbsp;Wayne Brady with his daughter, Maile, on a Daytime Emmy’s red carpet event.</p><p>In June 2021, Taketa also uploaded a similar video on her Instagram. It showed the journey of Maile from her preschool day to college.&nbsp;It is evident by Brady’s and Taketa’s social media that they love their child a lot. In November 2020, the comedian posted a video singing with Maile.&nbsp;&nbsp;Via the captions, he gushed about how much he loved her. He said, “I cannot tell you the joy and pride that fills me when I’m in the presence of my daughter.”&nbsp;He further said that he was humbled that Maile chose him and Taketa as her parents.</p><h2>Does Wayne Brady Have Kids?</h2><p>Other than Maile, Brady does not have any biological kids. However, he considers Taketa’s other family as his own, including her son.&nbsp;Taketa is in a relationship with Jason Fordham, and the couple is on good terms with Brady. The comedian considers Fordham a member of his family and even lives next door to each other.&nbsp;The Whose Line Is It Anyway? cast member made headlines last year when he revealed that Taketa, Maile, Fordham were quarantining together. He later explained to People that they were not living under the same roof.</p><p>Rather, they were neighbors and were limiting themselves to just two homes in the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2021, Taketa took to Instagram to explain that she and her partner were adopting.&nbsp;They welcomed Ana and her son, Sundance-Isamu, aka Sunny, into their blended family. Taketa then revealed that Brady was Sunny’s godfather, who was going to spoil his godson “like crazy.”</p><p>In September 2021, Brady uploaded a video on his Instagram where he introduced Taketa’s son, Sunny, to the world.&nbsp;He claimed he loved Sunny already, and he was helping his ex-wife and Fordham raise Sunny. He dubbed himself “Duncle” and said he was honored to be in Sunny’s life.&nbsp;Similarly, he thanked Taketa and Fordham for including him in their journey.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiumrGemnqjvsCdsGadqGLEqrLEZpuepZGjsaawjKOmoqakYrmms8ClZJqmlGK9qcXSopqapF2YwrTAzp2wZqeWYrWmvoydmK6fmKmys3s%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./fallout-76-how-to-get-mutations.html>&#171;&nbsp;Fallout 76 How to Get Mutations</a>
