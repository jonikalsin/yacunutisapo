She developed an interest in broadcasting at an early age.&nbsp;She attended Barry University in Miami, Florida, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in broadcast communications in 2009.&nbsp;While in college, she hosted a radio show called The Noise and managed the campus radio station WBRY 1640 AM.&nbsp;She also interned at several local radio and TV stations, gaining valuable experience and exposure in the media industry.</p><p>She began her career as the executive producer for 790 AM The Ticket in Miami, where she worked for three years.&nbsp;She then became the co-host of the morning-drive sports radio show, “Zaslow and Joy Show.” She also hosted “Fantasy Football Today” and “Thursday Night Live” on CBSSports.com.</p><p>Taylor joined FOX Sports in March 2016, playing pinch-hitter in several different FS1 roles, including filling in for Kristine Leahy on “The Herd with Colin Cowherd.” In August 2016, she became the moderator for “Skip and Shannon: Undisputed” with commentators Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe.</p><p>In 2018, Taylor moved from “Undisputed” to “The Herd with Colin Cowherd,” where she served as the news update anchor and co-host.&nbsp;She also launched her own podcast, “Maybe I’m Crazy,” and hosted “The Hang” on Facebook Live. In 2021, Taylor started her own Saturday program, “The Joy Taylor Show” on Fox Sports Radio.</p><p>Joy Taylor is currently based in Los Angeles, California.&nbsp;She is the co-host of Speak with LeSean McCoy and Emmanuel Acho on Fox Sports 1, which is headquartered in Los Angeles.&nbsp;She also attends various events and concerts in the city, such as the Beyonce concert at SoFi Stadium&nbsp;and the Blue Beetle special screening at TCL Chinese Theatre.&nbsp;She also enjoys living it up in Las Vegas, which is not far from Los Angeles.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Joy Taylor: Net Worth</h2><p>Joy Taylor has a net worth of $2 million, which she earned from her hosting career, endorsements, and sponsorships.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Taylor Opens Up About Her Domestic Violence Experience and Criticizes NFL’s Handling of Elliott Case</h2><p>Joy Taylor has shared her experience with domestic violence in several interviews. She <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that she grew up in an abusive household and learned to rely on herself for survival.</p><p>“I think I have an innate fear of relying on anyone else,” Taylor said. “That’s the for survival so I sort of apply that to maybe in an unhealthy way to everything that I do in life right so in my career I always have this anxiety that it’s not enough.”</p><p>In another Interview, Taylor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> her first experience of being abused.</p><p>“I will never forget the first time I was abused. Everything happened so fast, the attack, the police, my family getting involved, it was the worst night of my life.&nbsp;Until the next time it happened, and the next, and every time after that.”&nbsp;</p><p>She has also spoken about the physical and emotional abuse she suffered from her ex-boyfriend, the difficulty of leaving him, and the impact of the NFL’s handling of domestic violence cases on survivors like her.</p><p>In 2017, Taylor shared her personal story of domestic violence in the wake of the NFL’s controversial suspension of Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott, who was accused of assaulting his former girlfriend, Tiffany Thompson. The NFL suspended Elliott for six games after a year-long investigation, but the decision was challenged by Elliott and the NFL Players Association in court. The case sparked a heated debate about the NFL’s handling of domestic violence cases, the credibility of the accuser and the accused, and the impact of the suspension on Elliott’s reputation and career.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p>Taylor, who had been abused by a former partner, spoke out about her experience and the challenges of proving and escaping an abusive relationship. She did not name her abuser, but she stated that she was lucky enough to get out of the abusive relationship and find happiness. She also expressed her empathy and understanding for other victims of domestic abuse and urged them to seek help and support. She also criticized the NFL for overcorrecting and creating more confusion and damage to the cause of domestic violence awareness. She said on her show:</p><p>“We talked a lot about absolute power today. With absolute power is also absolute responsibility. So we know the buck stops with Roger Goodell here. Here’s the issue: The damage done to the reputation of Ezekiel Elliott, no matter what comes out of this, is never going to change. It’s done. But what I’ve been saying this whole week is the damage that this does to domestic violence awareness by overcorrecting is far worse than everything else that we’re discussing. It’s so difficult to get people, once they’ve made a decision, to understand how serious it is. And for those of you who don’t know, I’ve survived domestic violence. Horrible things. I’ve had someone six-foot-two try to choke me and suffocate me at the same time. He’s thrown me downstairs, kicked me in my chest after dragging me out of the car. I can go on and on. So I know what I’m talking about. It’s very difficult. I’ve been in that he said/she said situation. And believe me, the she said was 100 percent right. But it’s very hard to prove it if it’s just you and them. If there’s a smoking gun, and I hesitate to say this because I understand that sometimes victims have things they don’t want out there, but when you’re dealing with public figures, when you’re dealing with the repercussions that are on this level with the NFL and the amount of people that consume this product, if there’s a smoking gun, it’s time. Time. Here we are. It’s time to put that forward and clear all this up.&nbsp;You can’t come out with a six-game suspension for Ezekiel Elliott. “</p><p>Taylor’s statement was courageous and powerful, as she revealed her own trauma and called for more clarity and accountability from the NFL and the parties involved in the case.&nbsp;She also expressed empathy for both Thompson and Elliott, acknowledging the difficulty of proving abuse and the lasting damage to one’s reputation. She did not take sides but rather urged for more evidence and transparency to resolve the case.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Joy Taylor: A Voice of Diversity</h2><p>One of Joy Taylor’s personal goals is to foster diversity in the industry of communication. She recognizes the importance of having diverse voices and perspectives in the media and the challenges that underrepresented groups face in the field. She strives to be a role model and a mentor for aspiring communicators of color and to create more opportunities for them to showcase their talents and skills.</p><p>Taylor has shared her advice for aspiring sportscasters, especially women and people of color, who face discrimination and harassment in the industry. She has spoken about the importance of representation and empowerment for young black women in sports media. In an interview, Taylor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> her own journey and inspiration as a sportscaster.</p><p>Taylor said that she was influenced by Jemele Hill, the former ESPN host and columnist who is now a writer and podcast host for The Atlantic. Taylor said that watching Hill on ESPN gave her the confidence and motivation to pursue her dream of becoming a sports opinionist.</p><p>“My hope is the more that young black women see us on television that idea that you can do this also,” Taylor said. “I mean that’s what it was for me watching Jemele Hill on ESPN like I was able to see like okay not only is she on television every day she’s doing what I want to do which is give her opinion and she’s equal to all the men on the show and for me that made me to believe it could happen right.”</p><p>Taylor also acknowledged the challenges and barriers that women and people of color face in the sports industry, which is still dominated by white men. She said that she has learned to overcome the doubts and criticisms from others and herself, and to trust her abilities and voice.</p><p>“It’s so much harder to create something and know you can do something and no one else can see you in that space,” Taylor said. “But when someone’s already done it before you and you see the representation of yourself on television that inspires the ability to believe that you can do it and to follow that path.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Joy Taylor: A Foundation for Change</h2><p>Joy Taylor is not only a successful media personality, but also a generous philanthropist and a passionate advocate for diversity and social justice.</p><p>As a Barry University alumna, Joy Taylor has shown her gratitude and support for her alma mater by establishing a scholarship for students pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Communication disciplines.
