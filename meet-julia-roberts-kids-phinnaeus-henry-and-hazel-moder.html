A likely example is Academy award winner Julia Roberts; the Pretty Woman star is an actress and a philanthropist with ties to UNICEF. She is also the owner of a Red Om production company, through which she has served as executive producer to several movies. Over the years, Roberts has accrued much success in the industry; back in the 90s, she was Hollywood’s highest-paid actress for a long period. Along with these hats, Roberts also has a stable family life and is a proud and present mother of three; two sons and a daughter.</p><h2><strong>Julia Robert’s 3 Children Are From her Marriage to Daniel Moder</strong></h2><p>Two years after her broken-off engagement to Kiefer Sutherland in 1991, Roberts married country music singer Lyle Lovett in 1993. However, the couple divorced after two short years of marriage. The two had no children together.&nbsp;Julia met her present husband, cinematographer, and director Daniel Moder on the set of The Mexican in 2000.</p><p>At the time, Moder was married to Vera Steimberg, who he divorced over a year later. Roberts was also not single at the time of their meeting as she was dating actor and producer Benjamin Bratt, who is best known for Demolition Man. Following the finalization of Moder’s divorce from Vera Steimberg, he married Julia Roberts on the 4th of July 2002.</p><h3><strong>Julia Robert’s Twins Hazel and Phinnaeus Moder Were Birthed Via Caesarean Section</strong></h3><h3><strong>Hazel Moder</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Born: 28th of November 2004</strong></li></ul><p>Hazel Patricia Moder was born at exactly 1:21 am, only a minute before her brother. She is currently 19 and lives with her parents and siblings in Los Angeles, California. According to reports, Hazel attends Our Lady of Mercy School in Los Angeles, where she has taken an interest in sporting activities. According to Roberts herself, she also plays the violin.</p><h3><strong>Hazel Moder Is Her Mother, Julia’s “Mini-me”</strong></h3><p>While Hazel might not have inherited her mother’s brunette locks, Roberts revealed in an interview on Live with Regis and Kelly that her daughter takes after her sister with her blue eyes and blonde hair. Julia’s genes seem to be very strong, seeing as her daughter grows up to be quite the unconventional beauty her mother was and still is. That said, looking at her now, she seems to bear a striking resemblance to both her father Daniel and her mother, Julia.</p><p>Since her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>red carpet debut</a> during the Cannes Film Festival in July, where Hazel donned a yellow dress and Maryjanes walked alongside her father Daniel, fans have been dying to get a glimpse into the lives of the Moder kids. Hazel is not on any social media, and if she is, she’s operating under an alias because there seem to be no traces of her online besides the pictures shared by both her parents.</p><h3><strong>Phinnaeus Moder</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Born: 28th of November 2004</strong></li></ul><p>Phinnaeus Finn Walter Moder, on the other hand, was born only a minute after his fraternal twin, at exactly 1:22 am. Unlike in the case of his sister, info regarding where he goes to school is yet to be revealed. Still, according to his mother, Julia, he plays the cello and seems interested in soccer, but it is too early to tell, given that he seems pretty focused on school work.</p><p>According to his father’s Instagram, he seems to enjoy skateboarding. He currently does not have any social media handles or could be operating under an alias. Everything known about him is owed to both his parents’ social media pages.</p><h3><strong>Henry Moder&nbsp;</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Born:</strong> 18th of June 2007</li><li><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Los Angeles, California</li></ul><p>Henry Daniel Moder was born on the 18th of June 2007 in Los Angeles, California. Like his siblings, he lives with his parents in Los Angeles; however, not much is known about him. If Daniel Moder’s Instagram is anything to go by, it is clear that Henry is growing up to be just like his dad.&nbsp;In a 2018 Instagram post, Moder shared individual photos of himself and Henry skateboarding.</p><p>The 16-year-old, like the rest of his siblings, is also a bit of a musician. He plays the trumpet. He also does not have any social media account and seems to be a fan of the outdoors.</p><h2><strong>Julia Roberts As a Parent</strong></h2><p>Roberts seems to be very much a hands-on parent. She told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>E! News</a> that she sometimes feels like she’s directing with so much going on around her house. Roberts chose to raise her children away from the glitz and glamour of Hollywood simply because she believes that Hollywood changes people, especially young stars, so she sought to shield her kids from that and social media. She seems to have succeeded in her efforts, given that her kids seem to be very well adjusted.</p><p>While not all actors have the luxury of planning their acting gigs around their personal lives, this Hollywood legend can indeed do just that due to her being both a critical and commercial success with almost every role she takes on. This makes it possible for her to plan her work schedule around her children’s lives, and in situations when this isn’t possible, like it was when she was filming 2010’s Eat Pray Love, Roberts brings her family along.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/12/julia-roberts-family-2.jpg><p>While Roberts might be a major star to fans and the rest of the world, to her kids, she is no big deal. In an interview in 2014, she revealed that her children didn’t know she was famous; in a much later interview, she revealed that now that they know she’s indeed famous, they’re oblivious to just how famous their mother is.</p><p>Regardless of how famous their mother is, the Moder kids don’t seem keen on joining their parents in the industry. While all three of them appeared in minor roles alongside their mother in 2016’s Mother’s Day, they don’t seem to have caught the acting bug just yet, but we remain hopeful.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLqmsdNmoa6kmZZ6s7vBnqmtq12gtqW%2FjKmfoqaelrK2v4yhnKeqqWKur7CMoZiznZxiurCwxKtm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./david-reivers.html>&#171;&nbsp;David Reivers</a>
