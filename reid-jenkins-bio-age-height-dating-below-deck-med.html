On October 3, 2022, Reid took to Instagram to officially announce that he was a part of Below Deck Mediterranean. He wrote, “The secret’s out – I’m sailing HOME with a new crew. Come see what we get up to on the latest episode of Below Deck Mediterranean on @bravotv.”</p><p>Viewers first saw Reid as the deckhand in Home on Episode 14 (titled In a Blind) on the Peacock platform. During his first episode on the show, Reid told everyone in the crew how he has a tendency to say the wrong thing when he’s nervous. “Because, for whatever reason, I’m just really good at shoving my foot in my mouth… Sometimes I say or do something, I just feel nervous, I feel like I need to fit in,” he said on the show.</p><p>As the teaser of Episode 15 suggested, the new deckhand may find himself in a dangerous situation in the coming episode after he says to Courtney that she has an “undiagnosed case of narcissism.”</p><p>Reid’s bio on Bravo says that he knew that there was more to life than his small hometown and its two-lane roads from an early age.</p><p>Reid has about three years of experience in the yachting and marine industry. Coming to Below Deck Med, he was a captain for small yacht deliveries. Reid has also worked on tugboats before as Captain Sandy told Storm in Episode 14 that he should be able to “handle lines” on the yacht.</p><p>Below Deck Med star also worked on superyacht Excellence for 15 months until he had to leave the program for the filming of the Bravo show.</p><p>When Reid is off charter, Reid likes to do running, scuba diving, and volunteering.</p><h3><strong>Reid Jenkins Net Worth</strong></h3><p>As of 2022, Reid Jenkins’ net worth was reported to be under $300 thousand.</p><p>Reid changed his major several times in college until a point when he decided that he would be a marine surveyor.

He worked on Excellence for 15 months.</p><p>Ried has over three years of yachting experience under his belt. Besides working as a captain for small yacht deliveries, he is a philanthropist as well. He previously served on a volunteer board of directors for a basketball league for kids with disabilities.</p><p>Through Instagram on July 21, 2016, Reid shared that he was extremely happy to be able to volunteer with Backpacks of Tuscaloosa and impact kids’ lives.</p><h3><strong>Reid Jenkins Family</strong></h3><p>Talking about Reid Jenkins’ family, his parents are Joel D. Jenkins (father) and Elizabeth McKay Jenkins.

He shared a series of pictures, one of which was of him and Kassidy’s, with the caption reading “The happiest of New Years and the fullest of apartments.” Kassidy also shared the same picture of them on her Instagram the next day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Reid-Jenkins1-235x300.png><p>Judging from their Instagram, it appears that the two began dating towards the end of 2021 or early 2022.</p><p>On May 9, 2022, Kassidy shared pictures of herself with Reid and her friends on Instagram with the caption “Love a good weekend w the fav humans”</p><p>Recently, on September 27th, Kassidy shared tons of pictures with Reid and their cute little dog and captioned it: ‘Life recently with my favs.’</p><p>Talking more Reid’s girlfriend, Kassidy graduated from the University of Alabama in 2022 with a bachelor’s degree in Nursing.
